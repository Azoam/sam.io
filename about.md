> Hello, my name is Sam. I mean to keep this website as a professional/personal mix of things ranging from my own experience as a Software Engineer and my experience as a human being with a personality. Professional and Personal sections are labeled as such.

## TLDR Professional Resume

I copied some references from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) to show some markdown examples:

 - <u>Open System Solutions</u> - A wonderful group of engineers at Rutgers University working on Linux systems and other great Projects. My time there was spent experiencing Linux for the first time and fleshing out open source projects (helm) for our own use case.
 - <u>VMWARE</u> - I spent my time on the Quality team working on tests for their engineers. They requested of me to prototype a Kubernetes X Kafka system that would help them better organize their microservice setup. I did what I was asked and learned a lot about the two.
 - <u>Datadog</u> - Here I learned more about the SRE role, spent years working on supporting engineers to be more reliable in their service deployment and helping test that reliability under rigorous circumstances. I slowly transitioned into a focus on Chaos Engineering where I built several different testing mechanisms for services to prove reliability.
